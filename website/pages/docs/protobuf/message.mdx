## `message()` function

```typescript
export namespace protobuf {
    export function message<T>(): string;
}
```

`typia.protobuf.message()` function returns a Protocol Buffer message (structure) as a string value.

With this `message()` function, you can share `*.proto` files with other languages. If you want to customize byte order or define specific type (that is not supported in the TypeScript) like `uint32`, use comment tags by following [comment tags](#comment-tags) section.

```typescript
import typia from "typia";

interface Member {
    /**
     * @type uint32
     */
    id: number;

    /**
     * @byteOrder 4
     */
    age: number;
    name: string;
    email: string;
}
const message: string = typia.protobuf.message<Member>();
```

> ```proto
> message Member {
>     uint32 id = 1;
>     string name = 2;
>     string email = 3;
>     double age = 4;
> }
> ```





## Detour Expression
You know what? Expression power of Protocol Buffer is extremely narrower than type system of TypeScript. For example, Protocol Buffer can't express complicate union type containing array. Also, Protocol Buffer can't express multi dimensional array type, either.

In such reason, when converting TypeScript type to Protocol buffer message structure, lots of detour methods are being utilized. It would be nice if everyone designs with same detour expression, but usually each developer has their own designing style, so they all can use different bypass expressions for the same type. 

Note that, this is not only story of TypeScript, but also story of most programming languages like Java or C++. Developers are always getting suffered from such detour Protocol Buffer message designing. Therefore, if you're planning to share Protocol Buffer data with other languages or other system that is not using this `typia`, you have to be careful of it - impossible to ensure design consistency.


```typescript
import typia from "typia";

// WHEN UNION TYPE OR MULTI DIMENSIONAL ARRAY COMES
export type Bucket = Directory | File[] | Array2D[];
export type Array2D = Array<Array<number>>;

typia.protobuf.message<Bucket>();
```

> ```protobuf
> // PROTOCOL BUFFER CAN'T EXPRESS THEM
> message __Main {
>     oneof value = {
>         Directory v1 = 1;
>         ArrayOfFile v2 = 2;
>         ArrayOfArray2D v3 = 3;
>     }
> }
> 
> // THEREFORE, DETOUR METHOD WOULD BE USED
> message ArrayOfFile {
>     repeated File value = 1;
> }
> message ArrayOfArray2D {
>     repeated Array2D value = 1;
> }
> message Array2D {
>     repeated Array1D value = 1;
> }
> message Array1D {
>     repeated double value = 1;
> }
> ```
